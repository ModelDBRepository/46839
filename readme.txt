Abstract:
Neurons process information in a highly nonlinear manner,
generating oscillations, bursting, and resonance, enhancing
responsiveness at preferential frequencies. It has been proposed
that slow repolarizing currents could be responsible for
both oscillation/burst termination and for high-pass filtering
that causes resonance (Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000). However,
different mechanisms, including electrotonic effects (Mainen
and Sejinowski, 1996), the expression of resurgent currents
(Raman and Bean, 1997), and network feedback, may also be
important. In this study we report theta-frequency (3-12 Hz)
bursting and resonance in rat cerebellar granule cells and show
that these neurons express a previously unidentified slow repolarizing
K1 current (IK-slow ). Our experimental and modeling
results indicate that IK-slow was necessary for both bursting and
resonance. A persistent (and potentially a resurgent) Na current
exerted complex amplifying actions on bursting and resonance,
whereas electrotonic effects were excluded by the compact
structure of the granule cell. Theta-frequency bursting and
resonance in granule cells may play an important role in determining
synchronization, rhythmicity, and learning in the
cerebellum.
